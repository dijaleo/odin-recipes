    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup made primarily of miso paste, dashi (broth), and additional<br>
        ingredients such as vegetables, seaweed, and tofu.<br>
        This soup is bursting with miso flavor and delivers the perfect amount of tofu and seaweed in each bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1900mL of dashi</li>
                <li>2 sheets of nori</li>
                <li>100g of white or red miso paste</li>
                <li>100g chopped green onion</li>
                <li>125g of firm tofu</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place dashi in a medium sauce pan and bring to a slow simmer.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, place miso into a small bowl, add a little hot water<br>
                and whisk until smooth. This will ensure it doesn't clump when added to<br>
                soup later. Set aside</li>
                <li>Add the green onion and tofu to the broth and cook for 5 minutes.<br>
                Then add nori and stir. Remove from heat, add miso mixture and stir to combine.<br>
                <em>Make sure you do not boil it after adding the miso, or else it will lose its aroma.</em></li>
                <li>Taste and add more miso or a pinch of salt if desired. Serve warm. Best when fresh.</li>
            </ol>
