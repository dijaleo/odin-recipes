    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A popular Russian food dish that is typically made from thinly sliced beef taken from a tender cut of meat,<br>
    which is quickly sautéed in butter with sliced mushrooms and onions. The sautéed mixture is then combined with<br>
    a sour cream sauce and is most often served over a rice pilaf or noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>600 g / 1.2 lb scotch fillet steak / boneless rib eye</li>
            <li>2 tbspp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>300g / 10oz mushrooms</li>
            <li>40g / 3 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>2 cups / 500mL beef broth</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>150mL / ⅔ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use your fist (or rolling pin or mallet) to flatten the steaks to about 3/4cm<br>
            / 1/3" thick. Slice into 5mm / 1/5" strips (cut long ones in half), discarding
            <br>excess fat.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over high heat. Scatter half the beef in the<br>
            skillet, QUICKLY spread it with tongs. Leave untouched for 30 seconds until<br>
            browned. Turn beef quickly (as best you can!). Leave untouched for 30<br>
            seconds to brown. Immediately remove onto a plate. Don't worry about pink<br>
            bits and that it will be raw inside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tbsp oil and repeat with remaining beef.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down to medium high. Add butter, melt. Then add onions, cook for 1<br>
            minute, then add mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Cook mushrooms until golden. Scrape bottom of fry pan to get all the golden<br>
            bits off (this is flavour!).</li>
            <li>Add flour, cook, stirring, for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add half the broth while stirring. Once incorporated, add remaining broth.</li>
            <li>Stir, then add sour cream and mustard. Stir until incorporated (don't worry if it<br>
            looks split, sour cream will "melt" as it heats).</li>
            <li>Bring to simmer ,then reduce heat to medium low. Once it thickens to the<br>
            consistency of pouring cream (3 - 5 minutes), adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add beef back in (including plate juices). Simmer for 1 minute, then remove<br>
            from stove immediately. (Note 4)</li>
            <li>Serve over pasta or egg noodles, sprinkled with chives if desired.</li>
        </ol>
